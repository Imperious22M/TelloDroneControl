# Tello Controller Ground Station
 This repository contains a simple ground station for the DJI Tello drone. It is a simple program that reads the input from a generic joystick and sends them to the drone. It works best with an Xbox controller, but others can be used if the source code is modified. The program is not done and was made as a small project.  

It can be used by simply downloading the code, opening the src folder using visual studio or any other java IDE and running main. As long as the environment variables for java have been properly set all libraries required to run it are already included in the repository. I did not write the libraries, but rather found them on the internet.
