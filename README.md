# Tello Controller Ground Station
 This repository contains a simple ground station for the DJI Tello drone. It is a simple program that reads the input from a generic joystick and sends them to the drone. It works best with an Xbox controller, but others can be used if the source code is modified. The program is not done and was made as a small project.
